# PetNest
Repository for my course project during MSSA.

PetNest is a developing web application designed to be a one stop shop for everyone interested in having pets. The first versions will only pertain to those wishing to become owners of a new pet from shelters in their area. Designed like current dating apps, PetNest is a new fun and exciting way to find you, or your family's new best friend who's waiting for you at a shelter nearby. This applications initial launch is meant to give users the opportinity to view pets within parameters they set via filters (such as dog, cat, etc. and even breed). This is also a way for shelters to gain publicity so that they can give more opportunity to the animals they may be housing. Users will be able to get detailed information about the pets they are looking at such as age, certain medical history, and even behaviour if the shelters input that information so that the viewers have a better idea as to if their home is a good fit for the animals. If users are unsure, they can always contact the shelter through the app, or of course save the animal under as a favorite and address it at a later time.
